coala-bears 0.10.1
==================

Bugfixes:

- Remark dependency has been pinned back to ~5.4 because version 6 changes
  current behavior and breaks tests. This is a hotfix which will be rolled
  back when the upstream addresses this.
 
coala-bears 0.10.0
==================

This release, we had 97 commits contributed by 42 contributors.

The coala website has been updated to a new, more modern design. You can now
find a quick overview of bears and their settings at 
http://coala.io/#!/languages. We also have sample a bear output on the front
page for some common languages.

Separation of bear dependencies from the ``coala_bears`` package is planned. This
release will keep the same behavior as previous releases. However to keep
current installation behavior in the future, please use the pip package index
option ``[alldeps]`` as in ``pip3 install coala_bears[alldeps]``.

Here are the important changes and additions. This release tracks coala 0.10.
please see the coala release notes for the improvements in this version.

**New Bears**

Haskell:

- `GhcModBear` - Checks your Haskell code for syntax errors.

Python:

  with side effects.

  system (pip, distribute, etc).

You can look up the new settings at http://coala.io/#!/languages.

- `GitCommitBear`
- `InvalidLinkBear`
- `MarkdownBear`

**Deprecated Settings**

- `InvalidLinkBear` - ``timeout`` setting has been deprecated. Use

them in action right away.

Here are the important changes and additions, of course coala was upgraded to
0.9 so you can enjoy all it's new features and bugfixes:

**New Bears:**

Language Independent:

  Notebooks.

  requirements.

- `SCSSLintBear`

**Deleted Settings:**

- `CSecurityBear` does not accept a `neverignore` setting anymore. Those kinds
  of issues are and should be consistently handled by coala.

**Deprecated Settings:**

- The `ignore_regex` setting from `InvalidLinkBear` was deprecated in favour of
  `link_ignore_regex` for more clarity in coafiles.
- `KeywordBear` accepts only one `keywords` argument. The `ci_keywords` and
  `cs_keywords` arguments have been deprecated.
- `JSHintBear` provides an `es_version` argument that implies the
  `use_es6_syntax` argument. The latter has been deprecated in favour of the
  former.
- `JSHintBear` provides a more flexible `javascript_strictness` argument
  instead of the `allow_global_strict` which has been deprecated.
- `RuboCopBear` uses `naming_convention` instead of `name_case` now.

**Other Bear Enhancements:**

- The `coala-bears` package does no longer require Java upon installation.
- `VultureBear` picks up global dependencies.
- `ESLintBear` shows errors as `WARNING` in coala. This simplifies debugging
  bad ESLint configurations.
- `KeywordBear` can now automatically remove TODO comments for any language
  coala has `Language` definitions for.
- `FilenameBear` supports the `spacecase` convention.
- `KeywordBear` checks for `todo` and `fixme` by default.
- `GitCommitBear` has improved result messages.
- `YAMLLintBear` does not check for `document-start` by default. This was not
  a commonly chosen setting.
- `YapfBear` will pass files in-memory to save precious IO time.

**Major API Changes:**

- The bears testing modules were moved to the coalib and are deprecated.

**Bug Fixes:**

- `AnnotationBear` yields a `HiddenResult` with an error message instead of
  raising an exception, when the desired language is not available.

  the ``REQUIREMENTS`` attribute. This is one of the requirement objects
  supporting various package managers such as ``apt-get``, ``dnf``,
  ``yum``, ``pip``, ``npm``, ``gem``, and so on. To learn more, please
